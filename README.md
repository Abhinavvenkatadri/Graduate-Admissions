# :boom: Graduate-Admissions : SOPs :orange_book:

Graduate Admissions is tricky waters. As the admission season comes up, I have been getting a lot of requests asking me to share my SOPs. Having applied to various cohorts, and various programs, I have had my fair range of different SOPs. To make it easier and help people build their own SOPs I have created this respository with all my SOPs. If you find this respository userful consider sharing with your friends and ofcourse feel free to give a star! 

Please note, you might find a lot of repetition across the SOPs. But should give you some idea on how I went about changing the SOPs for different Universities and with different application cycles (2020 and 2021). You can also observer the transition between MS SOPs and PhD SOPs.
