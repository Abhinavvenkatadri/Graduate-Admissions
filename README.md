# Graduate-Admissions : SOPs

Graduate Admissions is tricky waters. As the admission season comes up, I have been getting a lot of requests asking me to share my SOPs. Having applied to various cohorts, and various programs, I have had my fair range of different SOPs. To make it easier and help people build their own SOPs I have created this respository with all my SOPs. If you find this respository userful consider sharing with your friends and ofcourse feel free to give a star!
